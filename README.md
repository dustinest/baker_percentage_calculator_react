# App to convert any baker's recipe to Sourdough

The goal of this appp is to calculate any baking recipe to sourdough based on baker's percentgages.
There are some hacks in code which might need some attention (IE starter for pancakes).

Check [src/data/PredefinedRecipes.ts](src/data/PredefinedRecipes.ts) for predefined recipes.

// TODO: at the moment the inputs do not matter but they should!
